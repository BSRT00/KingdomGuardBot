Select the option that is applicable based on the power of the Frost Behemoth. Attack costs 10AP (or less with AP heroes), while Rally costs 20AP (or less with AP heroes).\n\nAs you reach the higher levels of Frosty Behemoth and need to rally, you can set a power limit to the rally in order to pull stronger troops from your alliance to beat it. Using Quick Rally is another method to pull the troops at a faster pace. See #Tips&Tricks\n\nNote: If you do not manage to kill the Frost Behemoth, it will remain in place for 1 hour before it disappears.\n\nHow to set up a Rally Power Limit:\n1. Click on the Frost Behemoth.\n2. Click on the swords icon.\n3. Type the minimum power of troops you want entering your rally.\n4. Check the box if you want these settings to be applied for each rally (optional).",
